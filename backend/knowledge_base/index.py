NeuroAid RAG - Knowledge Base Index
=====================================
NEW FILE v2.0

Provides retrieve_relevant_chunks() for the RAG pipeline.

In production:
  - Replace this with a vector database (Pinecone, Chroma, FAISS)
  - Embed documents from: NIH, WHO, Alzheimer's Association, Parkinson's Foundation
  - Use sentence-transformers for embedding + cosine similarity retrieval

For now: keyword-based fallback with curated educational snippets.
Only trusted sources are included.

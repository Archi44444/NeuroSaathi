"""
NeuroAid RAG - Guardrail Rules
================================
NEW FILE v2.0

Blocks or redirects questions that:
  - Ask for a diagnosis ("Do I have Alzheimer's?")
  - Ask for medication advice ("What medicine should I take?")
  - Ask for specific dosage / treatment protocols
  - Request interpretation as a definitive clinical result

If triggered, returns a safe, empathetic redirect response.
